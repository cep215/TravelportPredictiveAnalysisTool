      Being able to plan for the future is vital for accelerating the growth of a business,
      but knowing what to plan for relies on good guesswork.
      How can growing travel agencies find out how to plan for the future market?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Travelport Predictive Analysis (TPA) tool is the web application that provides information on
      future booking trends, and projected market shares of travel destination around the world.
      Updated daily, and taking into account all sales of competitors,
      it provides the information you need to take advantage of the future.

      The project was proposed by Travelport, a travel commerce platform providing distribution,
      technology, payment and other solutions for the travel and tourism industry.
      They will use the outcome as a proof of concept code for market trend prediction which could be
      adapted and integrated with their existing services.
      Since extremely few travel service providers would have the scale of data required for predictions,
      only agencies which use Travelport would be able to use this.
